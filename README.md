My project aims to forecast monthly fuel prices for Special 95 gasoline in the UAE by analyzing historical trends and external economic factors. It is a work in progress. 
Leveraging a dataset I compiled—spanning from January 2015 to the present—I’ve cleaned and explored the data to identify patterns, such as seasonal fluctuations and correlations with global oil prices.
Currently, I’m prototyping time-series models to predict prices 3–6 months ahead, with preliminary results showing promising accuracy (±5% error).
Future steps include refining the model by incorporating real-time crude oil price APIs, UAE tax policy changes, and demand variables like tourism trends. 
The end goal is to deploy the model as an interactive dashboard for businesses and consumers to plan fuel expenses proactively.
